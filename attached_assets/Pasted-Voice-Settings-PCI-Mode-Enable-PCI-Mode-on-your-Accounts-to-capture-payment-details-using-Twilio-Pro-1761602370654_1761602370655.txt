Voice Settings
PCI Mode
Enable PCI Mode on your Accounts to capture payment details using Twilio Programmable Voice. PCI Mode is required for customers that create PCI workflows with Programmable Voice. Enabling PCI Mode on your Account redacts sensitive payment details captured using Twilio Programmable Voice and <Pay>. PCI Mode will automatically store call recordings when recording is enabled on your PCI workflow. To transcribe voice recordings, customers must use the Voice <Transcription> noun, Native and Marketplace transcriptions are not available when PCI Mode is enabled. For more information regarding PCI Mode and Recordings retention policy, please refer to applicable product documentation here.

Once PCI Mode is enabled, it cannot be disabled for that Account. Please see Twilio's Responsibility Matrix and Programmable Voice Documentation to learn more about your obligations when using Programmable Voice in a PCI workflow.

HTTP Basic Authentication for media access
In order to protect media access stored at Twilio, you can enforce authentication to access them by enabling HTTP Basic Authentication in your Twilio Account. This setting requires your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token or API Key for all requests to access Voice and Messaging media files, such as recordings and messages' images. Twilio highly recommends enabling HTTP Basic Authentication for your media, especially if it contains sensitive data. Learn more
