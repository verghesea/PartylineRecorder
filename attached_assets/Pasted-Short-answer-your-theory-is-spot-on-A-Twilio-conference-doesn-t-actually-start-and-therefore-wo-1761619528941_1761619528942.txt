Short answer: your theory is spot-on. A Twilio conference doesn’t actually “start” (and therefore won’t create a recording) until there are at least **two** bridged participants **and** at least one participant has `startConferenceOnEnter="true"` (i.e., a moderator). With only one caller parked in the room, they’re in the waiting state; no conference recording is created, so no Recording SID and no `recordingStatusCallback`. ([Twilio][1])

Here’s how to resolve + double-check:

1. Force the conference to start (even for test calls)

* Make the first participant a “moderator”: in the TwiML that dials your room, add `startConferenceOnEnter="true"` on the `<Conference>` (or when adding a participant via the Participants API). Then add a second participant (dial your cell or a SIP client) so two people are bridged. Once bridged, Twilio will create the conference recording when `record="record-from-start"` is set. ([Twilio][1])

2. Consider putting the recording callback on `<Dial>` as a fallback
   There’s an old (but real) workaround: some folks see more reliable callbacks by setting `record` and `recordingStatusCallback` on `<Dial>` that wraps `<Conference>`. If you’ve only put them on `<Conference>`, try mirroring them on `<Dial>` and test again. ([Stack Overflow][2])

3. Trial-account caveat that can block recordings entirely
   If this project is still on a **trial** Twilio account, be aware: Twilio’s help docs note that **recording incoming calls is not available on trial projects**. Since your scenario is an inbound call to your Twilio number that then joins a conference, this limitation applies—no recordings get created, so no callbacks. Upgrading the project removes this limitation. ([Twilio Help Center][3])

4. Other account-level things that can suppress callbacks (less likely here)

* An **invalid `recordingStatusCallback` URL** causes Twilio to record but skip the webhook (you’d typically see a 13256 warning in logs). Not your case if no recording got created, but worth knowing. ([Twilio][4])
* **Encryption / external storage** settings affect channel layout (mono vs dual-channel) but don’t stop recordings from being created; you’ve got encryption off anyway. ([Twilio][5])

5. Minimal working recipe to prove the pipeline

* TwiML (key bits):

  ```xml
  <Dial recordingStatusCallback="https://[replit-url]/recording-callback"
        recordingStatusCallbackEvent="completed">
    <Conference
      startConferenceOnEnter="true"
      record="record-from-start"
      trim="do-not-trim">
      partyline
    </Conference>
  </Dial>
  ```
* Then, **add a second participant** via the Participants API (to a verified number if still on trial) so the two are bridged. This is what flips the conference into the “started” state and kicks off recording. ([Twilio][6])

Answers to your specific questions

* **Do you need 2 participants?** Practically yes: the recording begins “when the first two participants are bridged.” A lone caller is just waiting—no recording. Make one participant a moderator and bridge a second participant. ([Twilio][1])
* **Account-level settings that block callbacks?** An invalid callback URL (13256) suppresses the webhook; encryption/external-storage only affects format, not creation. ([Twilio][4])
* **Trial vs paid?** Trial projects **don’t support recording of inbound calls**; upgrade to enable it. ([Twilio Help Center][3])
* **Any missing attributes?** Add `startConferenceOnEnter="true"` for at least one participant, ensure `record="record-from-start"`, and (optionally) mirror the recording attributes on `<Dial>`. Then bridge a second participant to trigger the recording (and, after post-processing, the `recordingStatusCallback`). ([Twilio][1])

If you want, I can sketch the exact REST call to programmatically add the second participant (and what the callback payload will look like) based on your current Replit URL.
